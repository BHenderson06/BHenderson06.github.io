### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I was able to program a simple game made for 2 people. Being able to create these basic games with c++ is something that I will always enjoy doing. So being able to make a game about guessing the number the other player selected was fun and pushed me to create personal projects.

* Lab 8
    Lab 8, Part 2 was another of my favorite labs since it gave me better practice working with loops. This lab was really tedious since the pattern didnâ€™t match the expected output. Despite that this became one of my favorites since the fix to the error was to change the loops less and greater than statements.

* Lab 12
    Lab 12, Part 2 was one of my favorite labs since I was able to realize how much I've learned this year. As I was able to get it done without too much confusion although getting the exact output was a hassle. Looking past all this I still enjoyed reflection and printing out images.
